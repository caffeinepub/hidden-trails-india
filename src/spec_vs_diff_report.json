  "summary": "REQ-31 is not fully satisfied based on the diff summary: the change is not clearly limited to the specific XPath-selected <span>, and additional styling/behavior appears to be applied to surrounding elements. The <span> is given `text-center`, but there is no evidence it is made full-width/block to ensure centering within available width.",

      "reason": "The diff shows changes applied to elements other than the <span> (e.g., the wrapping <a>), which violates the constraint to update ONLY the selected <span>. Also, the <span> only has `text-center` with no evidence of being made full-width/block to ensure centering within its available width.",

      "reason": "The shown component structure is `Button -> <a> -> <span>`, not `button -> div -> span` as in the XPath (`button[1]/div[1]/span[1]`), so it is not evident that the modified <span> corresponds to the XPath-selected element.",
