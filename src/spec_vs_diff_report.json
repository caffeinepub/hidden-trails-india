  "summary": "The diff updates the map to navigate with a macro-region search param and updates the destinations page to filter by that param, plus adds region-based destination counts to map tooltips. However, the diff evidence is insufficient to confirm that new offbeat destinations were added across all five macro-regions with complete Pulga-style detail fields, and it does not show explicit handling for unknown/unsupported region ids.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "If an unknown/unsupported region id is encountered, the app falls back to showing all destinations (or a clear empty-state), and does not default to North India.",
      "reason": "DestinationsPage casts the URL param to MacroRegion and unconditionally calls getDestinationsByMacroRegion(regionParam) when regionParam is present; the diff does not show validation or fallback behavior for unsupported values.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/pages/DestinationsPage.tsx"

    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Add offbeat destinations to ALL macro-regions (North, South, East, West, Northeast) in the same Pulga-style detail format (tagline, heroImage, snapshot, detailedDescription, transport, accommodation, localTransport, budgetBreakdown, budgetTotal, faqs).",
      "reason": "The provided destinations.ts diff excerpt only shows the Pulga entry (macroRegion: 'north') and is truncated; there is no clear diff evidence of multiple newly added destinations spanning south/east/west/northeast with all required detail fields and unique content.",
