  "summary": "Diff adds a new canonical destinations dataset/types and rewires Destinations, Destination Detail, and Home featured section to consume it, plus updates cards/images. However, there are likely gaps/risks: the dataset completeness (exactly 50) and specific image-URL coverage can’t be verified from the truncation, and there appears to be an import/export mismatch for the destinations module.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Canonical dataset contains exactly 50 destinations matching the user-provided list (1–50), with full required fields per destination, and reused everywhere without duplicated arrays.",
      "reason": "The added dataset file is truncated; the diff evidence only shows the first few entries and does not prove there are exactly 50 items nor that all 50 have the required fields and match the provided list.",

      "reason": "Some of the example destinations show external image URLs (e.g., Gurez, Tirthan, Kalpa, Chitkul) but the dataset is truncated, so coverage for the rest of the specified destinations (Barot, Chopta, Munsiyari, Dzukou, Ziro, Majuli) cannot be confirmed from the diff summary.",
