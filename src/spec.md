# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Center-align the label text of the currently selected button’s `<span>` within its available width.

**Planned changes:**
- Apply styling changes only to the targeted `<span>` at the provided XPath to make it occupy the available width and center its text content.
- Ensure no other elements’ layout, spacing, sizing, or styling are changed.

**User-visible outcome:** The selected button label text appears visually centered (not left-aligned) in its current UI context, with no other visible changes.
