# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Enhance Destination Detail pages with clear lodging and local transport guidance.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Destination Detail page (/destinations/$slug) to add a dedicated lodging section with explicit subsections for “Hotels” and “Airbnb” (in English), aligned with existing Card/card-glow styling, typography, and spacing.
- Add a new “Local Transport” section in the main content flow, covering at minimum “Rent a Bike” and “Cab/Taxi” with short, scannable descriptions, using existing patterns (Cards, icons, MotionReveal) and placeholder CTAs consistent with AffiliateCtaPlaceholder behavior.

**User-visible outcome:** On each destination detail page, users can read structured, English guidance about Hotels/Airbnb lodging options and local transport (bike rental and cab/taxi), with consistent UI and non-navigating placeholder CTAs.
