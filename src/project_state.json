    "Email functionality is out of scope: do not include any email capture, lead magnet forms requiring email, or email list growth flows.",
    "Site should support future scalability toward travel app, AI itinerary planner, premium members-only content, paid consultations, and sponsored partnerships.",
    "Design direction: cinematic/immersive youth-focused UI (adventure documentary + premium Instagram + modern startup) that stays bold but clean; avoid corporate/text-heavy/stock-photo-heavy vibe.",
    "Typography direction: bold modern sans headline font (e.g., Poppins/Satoshi/Montserrat) + clean sans body; big type, strong contrast, generous spacing, short paragraphs.",
    "Performance direction: mobile-first and fast-loading (optimize media like hero video + WebP images) while still supporting motion effects.",
    "Hero micro-interactions must be CSS-first and lightweight: avoid third-party animation libraries and avoid scroll event listeners where possible; use GPU-friendly transforms (translateY/scale) with will-change; no layout reflow/jank; respect prefers-reduced-motion; reduce parallax intensity on <768px and disable on low-performance devices; target Safari/Chrome smoothness and Lighthouse performance.",
    "Hero background enhancement: add a lightweight animated line-sketch layer (prefer SVG/CSS; avoid heavy JS/particle systems). Animate only transform/opacity/stroke-dashoffset with very slow cycles (15–25s), low opacity (5–12%), thin strokes (1–1.5px), faint blur glow (6–10px), reduce complexity ~50% on <768px, and fully disable for prefers-reduced-motion (static fallback)."
